      "i don&#39;t mean this in a dismissive way at all, this is sincere: if you have a problem with statutes of limitations, take it up with your senator. <br><br>the reason law enforcement said that is to clarify that by law, they can&#39;t do anything about <i>this</i> assault, but <i>going forward</i> victims are encouraged to come and speak to a victim advocate for support and direction. <br><br>i&#39;m not saying this police department is a bunch of superhero action figures who treat victims of domestic abuse with the upmost respect and urgency, because i don&#39;t know about them. i know victims of DV and sexual assault haven&#39;t been instilled with a lot of confidence in the way they&#39;re treated by law enforcement and the judicial system. <br><br>but that is what they were saying here: that it&#39;s out of their hands now, and this is why victims should come forward when they can, because if you hide it away, police can&#39;t help you. <br><br>honestly, the fact that there&#39;s security footage of that taking place is interesting. i wonder if she could have, at the time, gone to them and asked to see that footage. and maybe asked them to submit that to the police. because then it wouldn&#39;t have been her ratting on him, it would have been the hotel.\n",

The laws don&#39;t really help either. I never got justice for some really serious shit that happened when I was a kid and they didn&#39;t do anything. Nothing. There&#39;s alot of people down here who never got any justice for deaths of their family members either and they most likely wont get it.\n",
      "50 finna keep having a field day 😂😂😂\n",
      "Regarding &quot;allegedly,&quot; the problem is that if the police don&#39;t frame it that way, it gives Diddy&#39;s legal team the opportunity to try and get the indictment dismissed or otherwise thrown out of court by other means (the method depending on how far along they are in the pre-trial process) by claiming bias in the investigation process, the investigating entity trying to sway public opinion, potentially arguing that evidence is tainted (in this case, the video) and needs to be suppressed at trial, or that Diddy&#39;s constitutional rights have been violated as the police had made a determination of guilt before Diddy could exercise his right to a fair trial nefore a jury, etc. <br><br>I understand Charlie said he gets why they have to phrase it that way, but I can&#39;t help but feel like continuing to frame it as the police statement&#39;s wording doing a disservice to the situation when they are literally doing what they need to in order to ensure that it doesn&#39;t get thrown out is kinda...I don&#39;t know. It feels like acknowledging that something needs to be done a certain way to protect the integrity of the case, but still faulting the entity who has the responsibility of taking that approach. They may not be able to charge based on the video, but if they are investigating other potential charges and commentate on the video with any amount of &quot;certainty&quot; on this incident, it still can be used to illustrate bias in Diddy&#39;s legal defense. Or, hell, doing so may actually create grounds for Diddy to sue that jurisdiction&#39;s police department.<br><br>Unpopular take, but while the court of public opinion DOES matter for artists and entertainers, if we actually want there to be even a chance of Diddy facing justice for his abhorrent conduct, we need to give law enforcement the space to handle the case correctly without getting down on them...at least for this (there are a lot of reasons to scrutinize the police for sure, but I personally don&#39;t think this is one of them).<br><br>EDITED to add a few extra thoughts above, and add here: If statutes of limitation for certain crimes seem unjust to you, remember that the police and prosecution do not make the laws, they follow/enforce them. If it genuinely upsets you, I actually think that&#39;s kinda great, tbh. It means you care. But the most constructive thing you can do under the circumstances besides watching stuff about court cases is to actually contact your legislators to make your concerns known. Remember: they need your votes to keep their jobs, and THEY are the ones who make or change laws.\n",
